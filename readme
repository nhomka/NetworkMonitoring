This utility can be used to monitor the connections/availability of various different servers.

In order to run, update the private_configuration file to include all addresses you would like to monitor.  You will also need to update the smtp info/e-mail addresses of any accounts you would like a report sent to.

These servers will each be pinged on a regularly specified basis.  The results will be logged and distributed by e-mail once per day by default.

I use it to simply keep track of home networks, but I envision it being a convenient tool for people who rent out multiple homes and would like a free way to monitor internet availability.
